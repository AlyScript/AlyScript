## Hey 👋 About Me!

I am a 2nd Year Computer Science Student at the Univerity of Manchester. I'm interested in a number of different things and am usually reading a book and experimenting with something new.

You can visit my website at alyscript.github.io if you are interested and you can always reach out to me on Linkedin.
