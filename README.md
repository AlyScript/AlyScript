location: United Kingdom
education:
  [

  interests:
  [
    "anything that can be broken"
  ]

i am fairly "language agnostic"... so i won't list my "tech stack" here (because there isn't one)

also, i like to learn by undoing: that is, taking things apart and breaking them so that i see how they work
